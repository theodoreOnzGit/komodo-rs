# KOMODO

KOMODO is an open nuclear reactor simulator and reactor core analysis tool that solves static and transient neutron diffusion equation for one, two or three dimensional reactor problems in Cartesian geometry. Currently, KOMODO uses Semi-Analytic Nodal Method (SANM) to spatially discretise the neutron diffusion equation. While theta method is used for the time discretisation.

KOMODO is also a great learning tool for reactor theory classes, and we have been striving hard to make the input is easy to create. Among KOMODO' main objectives is to make all nuclear engineering students have access on reactor simulator code for them to use, learn, and modify for their own purposes. It is open and completely free, so everyone has access to the source codes and and play with them.

# About KOMODO
KOMODO is continuation of [ADPRES](https://github.com/imronuke/ADPRES). Since KOMODO name is considered more neutral and institution-independent, it is expected that more contributors join in this project.
